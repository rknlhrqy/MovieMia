# MovieMia
Web application to browse movies in a MongoDB.

It is implemented using ASP.NET v2.1 for the back-end and with React/Redux for the front-end.

The back-end connects a public MongoDB.

Here are the tools:
Back-end:
1, ASP.NET and C#
2, MongoDB Driver for ASP.NET
3, ASP.NET React/Redux project template
Front-end:
3, React
4, Redux and Redux Form

The web application I implemented is to query movies from a movie database. Just search the movie title and it will show the list of the movies whose titles contain the word you input. Click at any movie, it will show the details of this movie. Since the movie database is not that big, please try to search some common words such as "this", "all"...

This application is running at https://moviemia.herokuapp.com/
